The Chimera is described by Homer as "of divine stock, not of man, in the fore part a lion, in the hinder a serpent, and in the midst a goat, breathing forth in terrible wise the might of blazing fire"[1]. It was slain by Bellerophon, "Son of Glaucus of Corinth (or, according to another account, of Poseidon) and grandson of Sisyphus".[2] Bellerophon fled to King Proteus of Argos after slaying "a certain Corinithian, Bellerus"[3]. When in Argos "The wife of Proteus, fair Anteia, lusted madly for Bellerophon, to lie with him in secret love, but could in no wise prevail upon wise-hearted Bellerophon, for that his heart was upright."[4] Since Bellerphon didn't accept her advances "she made a tale of lies"[5] and told Proteus "Either die thyself, Proetus, or slay Bellerophon, seeing he was minded to lie with me in love against my will."[6] As a result of this Proteus sent Bellerophon to Lycia "and gave him baneful tokens, graving in a folded tablet many signs and deadly"[7] to show to the King of Lycia, who was Anteia father, so that Bellerophon might be slain.[8] When the King saw the tokens from Proteus, he "bade Bellerophon to slay the Chimera"[9] and Bellerophon was successful[10].

Harpies are referenced but not really described in text. In Argonautica they are described as "the Harpies with their crooked beaks"[1]. Though in acient greek art they are depicited as half-women and half-bird. The most notable story of the Harpies is in the Argonautica written by Apollonius Rhodius, which details the story of Jason and Argonauts on the quest for the Golden Fleese. In the Argonautia, the harpies are mentioned when the Argonauts visit Phineus. Phineus was given the gift of prophecy by Leto's son. Phineus used his gift to grant prohecies to man, which angered Zeus. Therefore Zeus punished Phineus with old-age, blindness and the curse of the Harpies. People who came to Phineus for prophecies would bring him food, but when Phineus attempted to eat the food the harpies would come down to snatch the food to eat or would cover the food in a foul stentch. Sometimes they would leave Phineus scraps of food, so that he could survive. The Argonauts visited the Island that Phineus lived. Phineus spoke to them in prophecy, describing his woes and stating that the sons of Boreas will come to no harm if they help him. The Argonauts, feeling sorrow for Phineus, they agreeded to help. So the Argonauts prepared a feast, and the Harpies descenced. The Argonauts fought the harpies and the sons of Boreas chased them off and followed them due to their tireless strength from Zeus. The sons of Boreas were stopped by the Goddess Iris due to the harpies being of Zeus' origin but promised the heroes that they would not plague Phineus.[2] [1]Argonautia 2.186 [2]Argonautia 2.178-287
Medusa is part of a family of monsters known as the Gorgons. They are described in Hesiod's Theogony. In Robert Graves Book "The Greek Myths", he describes Medusa and her origin as "But one night Medusa lied with Poseidon, and Athene, enraged that they had bedded in one of her own temples, changed her into a winged monster with glaring eyes, hugeteeth, protruding tongue, brazen claws and serpent locks, whose gaze turned men to stone."[1] The Gorgon was slain by the demi-god Perseus which Robert Graves also describes in his book which is parafrased as so. Persus was tasked to kill Medusa to stop the King Polydectes from marrying his mother. He then went to Deicterion to know which Gorgan was Medusa, since only she could be slain. Athena bestowed a gift of a tarnished sheild that he could use to look at the Gorgon, and Hermes gave him a adamantine sickle to cut off her head. He then went to the Graeae, who shared one tooth and eye. He stole them to gain the knowledge of the Stygian nympths who would give him gifts to kill the Gorgon. These gifts were winged sandles, a wallet to hold the head and helmet of invisibility. After this he headed to the location of the Gorgons, Land of the Hyperboreans. Using the reflection he then cut off Medusa's head.  [1]R. Graves, R. Riordan and R. MacDonald, The Greek myths. 1960. [2]R. Graves, R. Riordan and R. MacDonald, The Greek myths. 1960.
Minotaur is a a half-man, half-bull. Encyclopaedia Britannica 1911 summerises the story. The Minotaur was birthed from when King Minos of Crete was sent a white bull for sacrfice from Posedian. Instead of sacrificing it the King spared it, which angered Posedian. In punishment Posedian made the King's wife, Pasiphaë, to fall in love with the bull and lay with it. The monster was born and Minos shut the Minotaur in the Labyrinth. He demanded that the Athenians send fourteen people, half male and female every nine years due to Minos' son being killed by the Athenians. On the third sacrifice Thesus volunteered to go and slayed the Minotaur.[1] [4]"1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Minotaur - Wikisource, the free online library", En.wikisource.org, 2019. [Online].

Spartae - "They were a group of warriors born from the teeth of the Aeionian dragon. The monster was slain by Cadmus with the help of Athena. Following Athena's further instructions, Cadmus sowed the teeth and plowed them under. A number of men, armed and fully grown, emerged from the earth. Cadmus cast a stone among them and they fell to fighting among themselves, until five were left — Chthonius, Echion, Hyperenor, Pelor or Pelorus, and Udaeus. The five Spartae joined Cadmus in the founding of the city of Thebes and are regarded as the ancestors of the five oldest families at Thebes." In game they are repsented as Skeletons [1] "Spartae | Encyclopedia Mythica", Pantheon.org, 2019. [Online]. Available: https://pantheon.org/articles/s/spartae.html.  
Stymphalian Birds are described as "These fly against those who come to hunt them, wounding and killing them with their beaks. All armour of bronze or iron that men wear is pierced by the birds; but if they weave a garment of thick cork, the beaks of the Stymphalian birds are caught in the cork garment, just as the wings of small birds stick in bird-lime. These birds are of the size of a crane, and are like the ibis, but their beaks are more powerful, and not crooked like that of the ibis."[1] They were one of the trials of Hercules. [1] Pausanias.
